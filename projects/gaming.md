Small, probably half-iris, keyboard with kailh gold switches.
With led underglow. Cool if can have a rotary encoder to change
led color (it can go on the other iris half).
Color can also change w/ keypress rate.

Keycaps are mostly blank (white or whitish), except for some novelties,
and or artisans. Bold red or green theme.
